# Feature name here

[!include[banner](includes/banner.md)]

Describe your new feature, and then give an elevator pitch of the business value for it. Include high-value features that light up something exciting for our customers. This should be features that a customer needs to plan for...definitely larger than a hotfix or bug fix. This is information that you would previously have included in the roadmap.

If your feature has been designated as a key feature, complete this entire template. If it isn't, then only complete the **Business value**, **Describe the feature**, and **Status** sections.

## Business value (Required)
What are the top capabilities of this feature and what business problems does it solve.  

**Example**
End-of-day processing is a crucial element of retail operational workflow. This involves aggregation of raw transactions into meaningful business data to ensure that business and accounting rules are conformed to, before posting transactions as official business records. Improving the reliability and performance of this batch process and increasing the visibility of the processing for the administrator improves the user experience. Users can easily monitor the progress of the processing and see exactly what caused a validation failure. As a result, they can quickly resolve the issue and reliably retry the process without contacting Microsoft Support. 

## Describe the feature (Required)
What scenarios does this support. Include example scenario and screen shots. 

**Example**
New capabilities include improved statement posting performance by removing table deadlocks and optimizing batch processing. The introduction of a state model in the posting process aids in rollback and recovery, which eliminates data corruption and the need for manual intervention. Enhanced in-app diagnostics with detailed status, errors, and logs (including details of transactions included in the scope of the statement, transactions resulting in errors, and possible steps to correct issues) allow for easy troubleshooting.
