#  Improved gateway data sources settings experience


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   We plan on improving the experience around management data sources based on
>   users’ feedback. This includes allowing multiple credentials for a single
>   data source, allowing users to edit the names of data sources and the
>   ability to skip the test connection step during creating a new source.
