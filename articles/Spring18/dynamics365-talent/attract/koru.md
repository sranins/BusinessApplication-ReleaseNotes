[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Koru is a third-party company that applies predictive analytics to assess,
score, and rank candidates’ fit for an organization. Koru integration lets
customers score and rank candidates to predict who will be the best fit. Hiring
managers and recruiters can add a Koru project as an assessment activity to the
hiring process. Candidates then take the Koru assessment, and the result is
directly accessible from within Attract.
